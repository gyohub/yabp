# CRITICAL GLOBAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE) ⚠️
1. **LANGUAGE**: All output MUST be in **ENGLISH**. No Portuguese, no Spanish. ENGLISH ONLY.
2. **DIAGRAMS**: If a diagram is requested, it MUST be generic **Mermaid**.
   - Use ```mermaid``` code blocks.
   - **NO ASCII**.
   - **STRICT SYNTAX**: 
     - Quoted IDs are NOT allowed in graph definitions (e.g. `A["Label"]` is GOOD, `"A"["Label"]` is BAD).
     - Node Labels MUST be quoted (e.g. `id["My Label"]`).
     - No colons in Node IDs (e.g. `Class:Method` -> BAD, `ClassMethod` -> GOOD).
3. **FILE FORMAT**: Return Markdown or Code files as requested.

**CRITICAL: LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT**: All output, documentation, comments, and file content MUST be in **ENGLISH**. This is non-negotiable unless the user explicitly asks for another language in their prompt.

I am currently viewing the file `docs/pm/User Stories.md`. 

Please analyze this artifact data and perform your role-specific actions based on its content. 

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You MUST save your analysis, findings, or code changes to the file system. 
- If you are providing a review, audit, or plan: **CREATE A NEW MARKDOWN FILE** inside `docs/pm/` with your report. Do not just output text to the console.
- If you are writing code: Create or update the actual source files.

Shard user stories into one story per file. Shard epics into one per file each file containing links to the related user stories
