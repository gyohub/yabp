## Project requirement

This project is an API to manage PETs so that users can build UIs on top of it.

## Requirements

- CRUD operations
- Pet info: Name, adoption date, birth date, pet race, breed, date of death
- Pet history: Users can add date and description (one or more history records)
- Soft delete, just mark the pet as deleted
- User API so that all the api endpoints are protected. 


## Golden rules

- Endpoints are REST and use the correct http verbs
- Endpoints are authenticated
- Endpoints response in json format following the best http practices
- All the endpoints are authenticated
- Create a default admin user that can be later removed once there's at least one user created
- Add api versioning

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTION
IMPORTANT: Any markdown documentation created MUST be saved in the `docs/pm/` directory (e.g., `docs/pm/my_file.md`). Do not output files to the root.
