# CRITICAL GLOBAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE) ⚠️
1. **LANGUAGE**: All output MUST be in **ENGLISH**. No Portuguese, no Spanish. ENGLISH ONLY.

   - Use ```mermaid``` code blocks.
   - **NO ASCII**.
   - **STRICT SYNTAX**: 
     - Quoted IDs are NOT allowed in graph definitions (e.g. `A["Label"]` is GOOD, `"A"["Label"]` is BAD).
     - Node Labels MUST be quoted (e.g. `id["My Label"]`).
     - No colons in Node IDs (e.g. `Class:Method` -> BAD, `ClassMethod` -> GOOD).
3. **FILE FORMAT**: Return Markdown or Code files as requested.
