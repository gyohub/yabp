# US-015: API Versioning

**Epic:** [Epic 4: API Infrastructure](../epics/Epic-4.md)

**As an** API consumer  
**I want to** access versioned API endpoints  
**So that** I can rely on stable API contracts and migrate to new versions when ready

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All endpoints are prefixed with version (e.g., `/api/v1/`)
- Version is clearly indicated in URL
- Future versions can be added without breaking existing clients
- Version information is documented

**Technical Details:**
- Base path: `/api/v1/`
- Future versions: `/api/v2/`, `/api/v3/`, etc.
- Version in URL path, not headers
