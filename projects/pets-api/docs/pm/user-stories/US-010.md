# US-010: Soft Delete Pet

**Epic:** [Epic 2: Pet Management](../epics/Epic-2.md)

**As a** authenticated user  
**I want to** delete a pet  
**So that** I can remove pets I no longer need, while preserving data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can soft delete their pets
- User can only delete their own pets (unless admin)
- Pet is marked as deleted, not physically removed
- Deleted timestamp is recorded
- Deleted pets are excluded from default queries
- Cannot delete already deleted pets

**Technical Details:**
- Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/pets/{id}`
- Headers: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
- Response: `204 No Content` or `404 Not Found`
- Pet entity: `deleted = true`, `deletedAt = current timestamp`
